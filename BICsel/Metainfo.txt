Description: Select the most appropriate ARCH/GARCH model fitting data by minimising the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC).

Keywords: arima, bic, area, ac, ma, model selection, bayesian information criterion

Inputs:
-BIC 	: Calculates and returns the Bayesian Criterion
-n.like	: negative log-likelihood
-k	: number of free parameters to be estimated
-n	: number of data points
-p	: order of the autoregressive part to be tested
-q	: order of the moving- average part to be tested

Output: Matrix/ vector containing the BIC of the models we to test and the respective model with the smallest BIC

Example: Find the most appropriate ARCH model for fitting residuals generated by an ARMA(1,1) model, by ARCH models up to order 10.
