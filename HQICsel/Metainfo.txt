Description: Select the most appropriate ARCH/GARCH model fitting data by minimising the Hannan-Quinn Criterion (HQIC).

Keywords: arch, garch, hqc, area, ac, ma, model selection, Hannan-Quinn Criterion

Inputs:
-HQIC	: Calculates and returns the Hannan-Quinn Information Criterion
-n.like	: negative log-likelihood
-k	: number of free parameters to be estimated
-n	: number of data points
-p	: order of the autoregressive part to be tested
-q	: order of the moving- average part to be tested

Output: Matrix/ vector containing the HQIC of the models you want to test and the respective model with the HQIC

Example: Find the most appropriate ARCH model for fitting residuals generated by an ARMA(1,1) model, by ARCH models up to order 10.
