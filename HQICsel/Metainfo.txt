Published in: Unpublished

Description: Select the most appropriate ARCH/GARCH model fitting data by minimising the Hannan-Quinn Criterion (HQIC)

Keywords: arch, garch, hqc, area, ac, ma, model selection, Hannan-Quinn Criterion

Inputs:	HQIC: Calculates and returns the Hannan-Quinn Information Criterion
	n.like: negative log-likelihood
	k: number of free parameters to be estimated
	n: number of data points
	p: order of the autoregressive part to be tested
	q: order of the moving- average part to be tested

Output: Matrix/ vector containing the HQIC of the models want to test and the respective model with the HQC

Example: Find the most appropriate ARCH model for fitting residuals generated by an ARMA(1,1) model, by ARCH models up to order 10
